    <h1>IT 122</h1>
    <p>Hi, my name is <b>Kevin Phou</b>. I go by <b>He/Him</b>. </p>
    <p>So far of my first two quarters at Seattle Central, I've tooken courses in Business Communication, Project Managment, Data Analysis, Software Development Tools, Javascript 1 and Java. Whem I'm not studying, in my free time, I love to go to the gym</p>
    <p>I'm currently taking these courses so I can obtain my certifcate in Software Develpment & Testing. Also getting experiences so I can go into internship and other job oppurtunities. Maybe also use the college credits and get my AA or Bachelors</p>
    <p>The best advice given to me is <i>"Time is Money, don't waste it. You can always make that money back but you can never make that time back"</i>. </p>
    <p>Something interesting about me? I guess I like going and trying new adventures</p>
